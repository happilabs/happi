          HappiLabs, LLC is a mission-based, independent <span class="important important-blue">research</span> organization created by scientists and supporters of science. </p>
          <p>We collect data about scientists, the products they use, and the companies they interact with. <span class="important important-blue">Our goal</span> is to provide reliable and trustworthy data for making more informed decisions about their research--<span class="important important-blue">saving time and money</span>.
        </p>
        <p>Scientists, how much time do you spend searching for information about lab supplies? Let experts help. The less you have to think about this stuff, the lower your stress, and the <span class="important important-blue">happier</span> youâ€™ll be. &#9786;</p>

    <h2>How We Do It</h2>

    <div class="about-us-container">
      <div class="text-left-img">

          <p>
          We have organized a growing <span class="important">community</span> of scientists who share data about the quality of their life in the lab. They submit ratings and reviews via a system of surveys & interviews.
          </p>

          <p>
          At HappiLabs (HL) Central, a <span class="important">team of PhDs and grad students</span> organize, analyze, and summarize the data. Then we share the data with our community in print and online reports, email newsletters, and <a href="https://twitter.com/HappiLabs_org">Twitter.</a></p>

          <p>This <span class="important">equilibrium of data transfer</span> helps us create a more efficient research enterprise by identifying strenghts and weaknesses in the system.
