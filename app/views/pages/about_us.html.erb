          HappiLabs, LLC was established in Chicago in 2013. We provide virtual lab manager services with a speciality of shopping for scientific lab supplies, chemicals/reagents, and equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          We noticed that scientists do not have resources available to make informed purchasing decisions about lab supplies and all the companies who sell them.</p> 
          
          <p>What is a fair price? Who has the best quality?</p>

          <p>This results in <strong>wasted time and funding and false data</strong>. Therefore, our goal is to be a reliable resource for making quick, informed decisions about lab supplies.
        </p>
        <p>
          We evaluate lab supplies & equipment, and the companies who make & sell them, on 3 categories:

    <div class="container group">
      <div class="text-left-img">

          <p>
          We have organized a growing <span class="important">community</span> of scientists who share opinions about the quality of their life in the lab. They submit ratings and reviews about products, services, and companies they interact with.
          </p>

          <div class="">
            <%= link_to "Meet our scientists!", our_people_path, class: "btn btn-danger btn-how" %>
          </div>

          <p>To supplement user reviews, HappiLabs' scientists perform <strong>independent research</strong> on companies by scanning their website and catalogues, collecting quality documentation, and performing interviews.</p>
          <p>
          At HappiLabs Central, a <%= link_to "team of PhDs and grad students", our_people_path   %> organize, analyze, and summarize the data. Then we use the data to become <strong>awesome shoppers and lab managers</strong>. We also share some data in print and online reports, email newsletters, and <a href="https://twitter.com/HappiLabs_org">Twitter.</a></p>

          <p>This <span class="important">equilibrium of data transfer</span> helps us create a more efficient research enterprise by <strong>empowering scientists</strong> to make intelligent purchasing decisions, resulting in money and time savings.
