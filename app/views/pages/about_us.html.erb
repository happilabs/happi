          HappiLabs, LLC is a mission-based, independent research organization. We collect data about life scientists, the products they use, and the companies they interact with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to provide reliable and easy-to-read information for making quick, informed decisions about lab supplies--<strong>saving time and money.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Life science companies and the products they sell are evaluated on 4 categories:

    <h2>HOW WE DO IT</h2>

    <div class="container group">
      <div class="text-left-img">

          <p>
          We have organized a growing <span class="important">community</span> of scientists who share opinions about the quality of their life in the lab. They submit ratings and reviews about products, services, companies, and the publishers they interact with.
          </p>
          <p>To supplement user reviews, HL scientists perform independent research on companies by scanning their website, public rating services, and interviews.</p>
          <p>
          At HappiLabs (HL) Central, a <span class="important">team of PhDs and grad students</span> organize, analyze, and summarize the data. Then we share the data with our community in print and online reports, email newsletters, and <a href="https://twitter.com/HappiLabs_org">Twitter.</a></p>

          <p>This <span class="important">equilibrium of data transfer</span> helps us create a more efficient research enterprise by identifying strenghts and weaknesses in the system.
