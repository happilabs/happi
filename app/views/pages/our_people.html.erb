      <h3><span class="people-name">Tom Ruginis</span> - Founder & President (and Science Dude)</h3>
      <img src="ourpeople/tom_ruginis_founder_FINAL.png" alt="president of HappiLabs" class="bio-photo">

      <div class="text-right-img-people">
        <p>Tom has a degree in Molecular Biology from Benedictine University and followed that up with a few years of a PhD program at the University of IL-Chicago researching blood vessel development in tumors. Here he realized that the slow pace of research wouldn't allow him to have the impact on society that he wanted.</p> 
        <p>So he dropped out, took a job marketing & selling lab supplies, and became aware of an obvious problem--scientists don't have a resource to compare the price and quality of lab supplies, and it's affecting their progress. He now had a cause to rally around.</p>
        <p>So Tom thought..."If I can improve the efficiency of research by providing a resource to save time and money, I can play a role in the progress of all scientific research, and not only the Notch-1 pathway." To fuel his passion to fix this problem he is diagnosed with an auto-immune disease (Psoriatic arthritis). Helping scientists work efficiently helps them research the problem that has caused him, and the world, much pain.<strong> And all of this is the reason HappiLabs exists.</strong></p>

        <p>Aaron earned his Ph.D. in Pharmacology from the University of Illinois College of Medicine in 2011, and currently spends his days in drug discovery research.  As one of the earliest supporters of HappiLabs, his ideas and scientific mind have helped the company become what it is today.</p>

        <p>When not in the lab, Aaron spends some of his time making electronic music.  He hopes that his hobby of creating music can make life and the lab experience a little more upbeat for the listener (such as the cell culture hood).
